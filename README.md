# Chat application with socket.io.

## This app is built with node.js, express, axios.

### In this project we used two third party API:s (Joke API and GIF API) and one REST-API (Leave room). By typing "/" in the message field you are able to choose one API of your choice and it will display on the chat. When you click leave room it will disconnect from the room.

### Each time you enter the page, a form pops up where you have to enter a nickname, room name and password for the room. To chat in a room, you have to click on the room you want to enter with the correct password (even if you have created your own room), if the password is incorrect then an alert will display for the user. These rooms will be displayed on the left side and when a user is inside a room the room name will appear at the top.


### To run this app:
1. Install dependencies with **npm install**
2. Start server on **nodemon server.js**
3. Server is running on **http://localhost:1337** :boom:
